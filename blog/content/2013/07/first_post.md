I decided to switch from wordpress to pico. <a href="test">Pico</a> is a lightweight CMS and/or blogging software without the need of a database.
I'll also try to write more often and probably longer articles here and then.

Everything is hosted on my Raspberry now and this is just a test for my auto post-receive hook for git.
