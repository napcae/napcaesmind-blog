title: Welcome to my new blog

<p>I decided to switch from wordpress to pico. <a href="test">Pico</a> is a lightweight CMS and/or blogging software without the need of a database.
I'll also try to write more often and probably longer articles here and then.</p>

<p>Everything is hosted on my Raspberry now and this is just a test for my auto post-receive hook for git.</p>

<p>Here's a kitten video for your delight.
